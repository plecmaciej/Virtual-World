## Virtual-World

## Project Overview

This project, Virtual World, was developed during the second semester of studies as a part of learning object-oriented programming in C++. The main objective was to create a world simulator featuring animals and plants, each with unique strength parameters and special characteristics.

## Features

- Turn-based simulation – The game progresses in turns, where entities interact with each other.

- Diverse fauna and flora – Every animal and plant has unique strength attributes. Some plants have additional effects:

- Deadly plants like Nightshade or Sosnowsky's Hogweed can kill animals or you upon contact.

- Strength-boosting plants like Guarana can increase the strength of the animal that consumes them and yours too.

- Player movement – Navigate the world using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.

- Superpower mode – Activate an immortality mode for 5 turns.

- Randomized world generation – The player can choose the world size, while the initial placement of animals and plants is randomized.

- Game state saving and loading – Allows the player to save progress and resume later.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++

- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- File Handling: Save/Load system for game state preservation

## How to Play

- Choose the board size at the beginning.

- Move your character **HUMAN** using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.

- Observe how animals interact with each other and plants.

- Use the immortality superpower strategically (lasts for 5 turns).

- Save and load the game whenever needed.
